# PRD Template

> **Template Instructions:**
>
> - Replace ALL bracketed placeholders with real content
> - If you cannot fill a section with confidence, use `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: reason]` instead of guessing
> - Any `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers MUST be resolved before planning can proceed
> - Delete this instruction block after filling the template

**GitHub issue:** none | #[issue] (optional)
**Work ID:** [slug]
**Repository:** [owner/repo | none]
**Created:** [date]
**Status:** Draft | In Review | Approved

## Work Metadata

```yaml
issue: none | <number> # Optional; only a verified GitHub issue number, never guessed
depends_on: [] # Work IDs that must complete before this one
parallel: true # Independent read-only checks may batch; file mutations stay serialized
conflicts_with: [] # Work IDs that modify same files (cannot parallelize)
files: [] # Files this work will modify
acceptance: [] # Commands or observable checks that prove this work done
estimated_hours: 2 # Time estimate for planning

## Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?

[Clear description of the problem. Include user impact and business impact. If unclear, use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what specifically is unknown]]

### Why now?

[What triggered this work? Cost of inaction? Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] if motivation is unclear]

### Who is affected?

- **Primary users:** [Description]
- **Secondary users:** [Description]

---

## Scope

### In-Scope

- [List what's in scope. Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] for ambiguous boundaries]

### Out-of-Scope

- [List what's explicitly off-limits. Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] for unresolved scope questions]
- [Deferred to future iterations]

---

## Proposed Solution

### Overview

[One paragraph describing what this feature does when complete. Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] for uncertain design decisions]

### User Flow (if user-facing)

1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### [Requirement Name]

Brief description of what must be true.

**Scenarios:**

- **WHEN** [precondition or trigger] **THEN** [expected outcome]
- **WHEN** [edge case condition] **THEN** [expected behavior]

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** [constraint if applicable]
- **Security:** [constraint if applicable]
- **Accessibility:** [WCAG level if applicable]
- **Compatibility:** [constraint if applicable]

> If any requirement is unknown or unresearched, mark it `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what needs investigation]` rather than omitting it.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] [Specific, measurable criterion 1]
  - Verify: `[command or manual check]`
- [ ] [Specific, measurable criterion 2]
  - Verify: `[command or manual check]`

## Technical Context

### Existing Patterns

- Pattern 1: `src/path/to/example.ts` - Why relevant

### Key Files

- `src/relevant/file.ts` - Why relevant

### Affected Files

Files this work item will modify (for conflict detection):

```yaml
files:
  - src/path/to/file.ts # Why
  - src/path/to/other.ts # Why
```

## Tasks

Write tasks in a machine-convertible format for `prd-task` skill.

**Rules:**

- Each task is a `### [Title] [category]` heading
- Provide one sentence describing the end state
- Include `**Metadata:**` with dependency info
- Include `**Verification:**` with bullet steps proving it works

### [Task Title] [category]

[One sentence describing the end state]

**Metadata:**

```yaml
depends_on: [] # Task titles that must complete first
parallel: true # Can run with other parallel tasks
conflicts_with: [] # Task titles modifying same files
files: [] # Files this task will modify
```

**Verification:**

- [Command or check]
- [Command or check]

### [Task Title] [category]

[One sentence describing the end state]

**Metadata:**

```yaml
depends_on: ["<Previous Task Title>"]
parallel: false
files: []
```

**Verification:**

- [Command or check]

## Dependency Legend

| Field            | Purpose                                           | Example                                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `depends_on`     | Must complete before this task starts             | `["Setup database", "Create schema"]`      |
| `parallel`       | Can run concurrently with other parallel tasks    | `true` / `false`                           |
| `conflicts_with` | Cannot run in parallel (same files)               | `["Update config"]`                        |
| `files`          | Files this task modifies (for conflict detection) | `["src/db/schema.ts", "src/db/client.ts"]` |
