# Git Workflow and Versioning

## Overview

Git workflow keeps changes reviewable, reversible, and shippable. Treat commits as verified save points, not dumping grounds.

## When to Use

- Any meaningful code change that may be committed, reviewed, or shipped.
- Creating or finishing a feature branch.
- Preparing release notes, version bumps, or changelog entries.
- Splitting a large diff into safe review units.
- Working in a dirty worktree where unrelated user changes may exist.

## When NOT to Use

- Read-only investigation with no file changes.
- Throwaway local experiments that will be discarded before reporting.

## Process

1. Inspect worktree state before editing: `git status --short`.
2. Identify unrelated changes and leave them untouched.
3. Keep each change atomic: one intent, one reviewable diff, one verification story.
4. Prefer trunk-based flow: short-lived branches, small PRs, frequent integration.
5. Use commits as save points only after verification passes or after clearly labeling partial work.
6. Scope staging to your files only; never use `git add .` in a mixed worktree.
7. For versioning, update the smallest required surface: package version, changelog, migration note, release tag, or docs.
8. Before shipping, confirm status, diff summary, verification evidence, and rollback path.

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization                          | Rebuttal                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| "I'll clean up the commit later."        | Later cleanup often loses intent. Keep the diff clean while it is fresh. |
| "This unrelated formatting is harmless." | It increases review noise and can hide real regressions.                 |
| "One big commit is faster."              | Small verified commits are easier to review, revert, bisect, and ship.   |
| "The worktree was already dirty."        | Dirty worktrees require more discipline, not less.                       |

## Red Flags

- Staging broad paths without reviewing the diff.
- Mixing feature work, refactors, formatting, and dependency updates.
- Committing generated or cache files unintentionally.
- Version bump without changelog or release rationale.
- Claiming clean worktree without checking status.

## Verification

Before declaring git workflow complete, provide:

- `git status --short` summary.
- Diff or staged-file summary for touched files.
- Verification commands and outcomes.
- Commit/version/changelog action taken, or explicit reason none was needed.
