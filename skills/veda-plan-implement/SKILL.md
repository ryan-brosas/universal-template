name: veda-plan-implement
description: Plan work by collaborating with the Veda Navigator model before implementing. Use for planning a refactor, debugging approach, research, analysis, writing, or any course of action. Drives `veda -S plan-TASKNAME -m gpt-5.6-sol -p navigator-plan` to align on a plan; does not execute. Invoke when the user says plan, discuss, align, or wants to iterate on a plan before coding.

## Model routing (authoritative — do not substitute)

- Load-bearing planning / architecture / high-risk review → `agy --model claude-opus-4-6-thinking --mode plan` (direct `agy` CLI, NOT veda/gemini).
- Critique / follow-up → `agy --model claude-sonnet-4-6 --mode plan`.
- Cheap discovery / context curation → `veda` + gemini (`gemini-3.6-flash-*`, `gemini-3.1-pro-low`).
- `veda deep` (parallel solvers) runs on gemini and is only for "N independent attempts"; the final architecture decision still comes from claude-opus.

## Invocation — veda CLI (confirmed working)

Use the veda CLI with a **positional** prompt. The default backend/model are now fixed in `~/.config/veda/config` (`BACKEND="agy"`, `MODEL="gemini-3.1-pro-high"`) — no flags needed:

```bash
veda -S plan-<task> -p navigator-plan '<your prompt — inline ALL relevant file contents; veda sees only what you paste>'
```

- Pin explicitly with `-b agy -m gemini-3.1-pro-high` if you ever need to override.
- Keep one `-S` session name; follow up with `veda -S plan-<task> resume '...'` or `-p navigator-chat`. You implement afterwards with native tools.

**Do NOT use `agents.run({ runner: "veda", ... })`:** broken with veda-ts 0.75.8 — pi-fabric pipes the prompt to stdin, but veda reads positionals only (`src/cli/validate.ts` throws "No prompt provided"). Use the CLI until pi-fabric fixes the runner.

## Your Task

Collaborate, discuss, and align with the Navigator model on a plan using `veda -S plan-TASKNAME -m gpt-5.6-sol -p navigator-plan`. This applies to any kind of work: solving a problem, debugging, research, writing, analysis, or planning a course of action. Navigator has no tool access; everything it knows comes from the files you share via `veda sel add` and what you write in your prompts.

**Model:** `gpt-5.6-sol` is auto-detected by `veda init` from your installed harnesses. If a `-m`/`-b` (or other veda flags) was passed when this skill was invoked, use those instead of `-m gpt-5.6-sol` in every `veda` command below.

**Reuse the same `-S` session name** across `navigator-plan` and follow-up `resume`/`navigator-chat` so the conversation continues rather than restarting.

Use `-p navigator-plan` to start, then switch to `-p navigator-chat` for follow-up discussion. Only use `navigator-plan` once per task unless the user instructs otherwise.

**Involve the user when the work genuinely requires them.** Use your `ask_user` tool (or plain questions if unavailable) when the goal is ambiguous, a decision would change scope, cost, or direction, or input only the user can provide. Navigator advises; the user decides. Otherwise, when you have enough information to act, act.

### Escaping Backticks in Prompts (Critical)

**Backticks in double-quoted prompts get evaluated by bash as command substitution.** If your prompt contains examples with backticks, they will be executed as commands:

```bash
# BAD - double quotes evaluate backticks:
veda -p navigator-plan "The function uses `console.log`"
# Results in: sh: console.log: command not found

# GOOD - use single quotes (simplest):
veda -S plan-auth-refactor -m gpt-5.6-sol -p navigator-plan 'The function uses `console.log` to output.'

# GOOD - escape backticks in double quotes:
veda -p navigator-plan "The function uses \`console.log\`"
```

**Recommendation:** Use single quotes (`'...'`) for prompts containing backticks. If you need variable expansion, escape backticks with backslash in double quotes.

## Session Naming (Critical for Multi-Agent)

**Use a descriptive, contextual session ID** with `-S` to isolate your selection from other concurrent agents. Format: `plan-TASKNAME` where TASKNAME briefly describes the work.

```bash
veda -S plan-auth-refactor -m gpt-5.6-sol ...    # Planning a refactor
veda -S plan-pricing-research -m gpt-5.6-sol ... # Researching pricing options
veda -S plan-launch-doc -m gpt-5.6-sol ...       # Drafting a launch document
```

---

## Setting Context (Critical)

**You must run `veda sel add` before sending prompts.** This is how Navigator sees your working materials: source code, drafts, notes, specs, data, research documents, transcripts. Any text file works.

```bash
# Clear and build selection (use your session name)
veda -S plan-auth-refactor sel clear
veda -S plan-auth-refactor sel add "src/feature/" "docs/notes.md"

# Check token count
veda -S plan-auth-refactor sel ls
```

**Token budget (one rule):** Always start with full files. Check `sel ls`. 75k-125k tokens is acceptable. Only use slices if you exceed 125k, and pare down starting with the largest files. More context is better for Navigator, so prefer full files when possible.

**What to share:** whatever the problem touches, plus its immediate neighbors. Navigator cannot see your terminal or environment, so put observations in the prompt itself: error output, a causal timeline, data you collected, drafts under discussion. State your hypothesis if you have one; if you are stuck, say where.

### File Slices (Line Ranges)

Only when over the 125k budget:

```bash
veda -S plan-auth-refactor sel add main.c:10-50       # Lines 10-50 only
veda -S plan-auth-refactor sel add main.c:100-        # Line 100 to end of file
veda -S plan-auth-refactor sel add config.ts:25       # Single line 25
veda -S plan-auth-refactor sel add "src/*.c:1-80"     # First 80 lines of each file
```

| Syntax | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `file.c:10-20` | Lines 10 to 20 (inclusive) |
| `file.c:15-` | Line 15 to end of file |
| `file.c:8` | Single line 8 |
| `"src/*.c:1-50"` | First 50 lines of each matched file |

## Collaborating with Navigator

Think of Navigator as a senior collaborator you're pairing with. Your opening message should commit to a position, not ask an open-ended question:

- Share the user's prompt verbatim, plus who the work is for and what the output enables, so Navigator understands the actual ask rather than your interpretation
- State the goal and your proposed approach (take a stance; Navigator stress-tests it)
- Provide evidence anchors: file and section references for your key claims
- Name constraints and non-goals
- Ask 1-2 specific questions where you are genuinely uncertain
- Invite Navigator to help in any way, especially if you're stuck; a fresh perspective on a dead end is often the breakthrough

Example flow:
```bash
# 1. Set the context
veda -S plan-auth-refactor sel clear
veda -S plan-auth-refactor sel add "src/auth/" "src/api/users.ts"

# 2. Start planning conversation - commit to a position, carrying the ask VERBATIM
#
# Lead with the USER'S EXACT WORDS (quoted verbatim), then your framing —
# Navigator plans against the ask as given, so don't paraphrase it away:
veda -S plan-auth-refactor -m gpt-5.6-sol -p navigator-plan \
  '<USER PROMPT, verbatim, exactly as the user wrote it>

My understanding: [situation + evidence]. Proposed approach: [details]. Non-goals: [scope limits]. Key question: [your real uncertainty]. What do you think?'

# 3. Continue discussion (session-scoped resume)
veda -S plan-auth-refactor -m gpt-5.6-sol resume "What about edge case X?"
# Or switch to chat mode for back-and-forth
veda -S plan-auth-refactor -m gpt-5.6-sol -p navigator-chat "What about edge case X?"
```

Confirm alignment before you start executing. **Once aligned, you (the Driver) proceed to execution.** Navigator does not execute; you do.

---

## Execution

After aligning with Navigator:
- Carry out the plan using your native tools; keep it scoped to what was agreed
- Checkpoint with Navigator at plan-step boundaries, reporting only what you can point to evidence for: "step N done, verified by X"
- When results contradict expectations, paste the actual output verbatim and ask "repair or switch?"
- Two similar failures = mandatory Navigator consult before a third attempt
- Escalate to the user (via `ask_user`) per the rule above: scope, cost, or direction changes, or input only they can provide
- You can consult Navigator mid-execution:
  ```bash
  veda -S plan-auth-refactor -m gpt-5.6-sol -p navigator-chat "Quick question: should X handle Y this way?"
  ```

Before ending your turn, check your last paragraph. If it is a plan, a list of next steps, or a promise about work you have not done ("I'll...", "let me know when..."), do that work now. End your turn only when the task is complete or you are blocked on input only the user can provide.

When you write your final summary, write it for a reader who did not see any of the working thread. Lead with the outcome in one sentence, then the supporting detail. Drop the working shorthand: write complete sentences, spell out terms, and don't use arrow chains or labels you made up earlier. If you have to choose between short and clear, choose clear.

## Reminders

Onboard yourself with veda at `~/.pi/agent/docs/veda.md` before acting.
Key commands:
- `veda -S plan-TASKNAME sel add` to build context (quote globs: `"src/*.c"`)
- `veda -S plan-TASKNAME sel add file.c:10-50` to add line-range slices
- `veda -S plan-TASKNAME sel ls` to verify selection and token count
- `veda -S plan-TASKNAME -m gpt-5.6-sol -p navigator-plan` for initial planning (high reasoning)
- `veda -S plan-TASKNAME -m gpt-5.6-sol -p navigator-chat` for follow-up discussion (medium reasoning)
- `veda -S plan-TASKNAME -m gpt-5.6-sol resume` to continue a conversation (session-scoped)
- Output goes to stdout; use `-o file.md` to save response

Do not execute yet; all we want to do is iterate on a solid plan.
