# Deep Module Design

## Iron Laws

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
- **Interface is the design.** What the module *exposes* is what it is.
- **Hide complexity behind the interface.** Caller doesn't read internals to use it.
- **Push complexity down, expose simplicity up.** If user thinks about it, module failed.
- **One concept per module.** Two things = two interfaces pretending to be one.
- **Small interface, deep implementation.** Hard problem, small surface.
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

## When to Use

Designing a new module; reviewing structure; refactoring shallow modules; "this class is too big"; API of a new library; service boundary.

## When NOT to Use

Trivial one-function helpers; structure is fine and change is in body; "design" without a real module.

## The Depth Metric

```
Depth = (impl size) / (interface size)
```

- **Deep**: small interface, large impl. Good. Hides complexity.
- **Shallow**: large interface, small impl. Bad. Exposes its guts.

10 public methods, 50-line constructor = shallow. 1 public method, 1000 lines = deep (if it solves a real problem).

## Interface Tells

| Sign                            | Meaning                     |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Many public methods             | Module is doing too much    |
| Methods with complex args       | Caller knows too much       |
| Methods returning complex types | Caller handles too much     |
| Public state                    | Caller can break invariants |
| Config that requires docs       | Hide defaults               |
| `addX`/`addY`/`addZ`            | One method, options         |

## Design Tells

| Sign                      | Meaning                     |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Impl bigger than expected | Caller reads the impl       |
| Two ways to do the same   | Pick one, hide the other    |
| Caller calls 3+ methods   | One method, the right thing |
| "Don't call from outside" | Should be private           |
| Tests mock internals      | Internals leaking           |

## Refactoring Toward Depth

1. **Find shallowest surface.** List public methods + args.
2. **Combine methods.** `addUser + addUserAddress` → `addUser({ ..., address })`.
3. **Hide the helper.** Make internal calls private.
4. **Move config inside.** Env, sensible default. Not per-call args.
5. **Return less.** `{ ok, data, error, meta }` → `data`. Errors at boundary.

## Test Seams via Interface

The interface IS the test seam. Test the interface, not the implementation. If your test needs to mock an internal call, the internal is leaking.

```ts
// GOOD: test the interface
const svc = new UserService({ db: mockDb, mailer: mockMailer })
await svc.addUser({ name, email })
expect(mockDb.users).toContain(...)

// BAD: test the internals
jest.spyOn(svc, "_insertIntoDb")
jest.spyOn(svc, "_sendEmail")
```

## Common Mistakes

Shallow modules; exposed state; config in args (env); "two ways to do it"; tests mock internals; `addX`/`addY`/`addZ`; "don't call from outside" comments; pass-through modules.

## Red Flags

10+ public methods; `addX`/`addY`/`addZ`; public state; config in args; "don't call from outside"; tests mock internals; pass-through; "two ways to do it"; 3+ methods in sequence.

## Anti-Patterns

**Shallow module**; **public state**; **config in args**; **two ways to do it**; **tests mock internals**; **addX/addY/addZ**; **pass-through**; **complex return types**.
