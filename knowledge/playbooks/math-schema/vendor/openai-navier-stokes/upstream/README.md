# Finite time blowup for Navier–Stokes and Euler equations

This repository contains Lean 4 formalizations of the results presented in
“Finite time blowup for Navier–Stokes” and
“Finite time blowup for the Euler equation” by OpenAI.

## Navier Stokes

For every positive viscosity, we prove two results:

- **Whole space $\mathbb{R}^3$:** There exist smooth initial data and forcing for
  which no global smooth solution with uniformly bounded kinetic energy exists.
- **Periodic torus $\mathbb{R}^3/\mathbb{Z}^3$:** There exist smooth periodic
  initial data and forcing for which no global smooth solution exists.

These are alternatives [**(C)**](https://www.claymath.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/navierstokes.pdf#page=2) “Breakdown of Navier–Stokes solutions on ℝ³”
and [**(D)**](https://www.claymath.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/navierstokes.pdf#page=2) “Breakdown of Navier–Stokes Solutions on ℝ³/ℤ³”
in the Clay Mathematics Institute’s [official problem description](https://www.claymath.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/navierstokes.pdf)
of the [Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness](https://www.claymath.org/millennium/navier-stokes-equation/)
[Millennium Prize Problem](https://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/).

## Euler

We construct smooth, compactly supported, divergence-free initial velocity on
$\mathbb{R}^3$ whose solution to the unforced incompressible Euler equations
develops a singularity in finite time. The velocity’s $C^1$ norm becomes unbounded
near that time, and the time integral of the vorticity’s $L^\infty$ norm diverges.

## Building the formalizations

The project uses Lean 4.34.0-rc2, Mathlib, and Lake. With
[elan](https://github.com/leanprover/elan) installed, fetch the mathlib cache and build the formalizations with:

```sh
lake exe cache get
lake build
```

## Independent proof checking

For instructions on checking the formalizations with Comparator, see the
[ComparatorChallenges README](ComparatorChallenges/README.md).
