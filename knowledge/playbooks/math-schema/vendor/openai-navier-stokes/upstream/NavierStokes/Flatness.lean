# Scalar flatness and fixed power losses

This file isolates the scalar asymptotic argument used in Lemmas 11.2--11.5
of the candidate manuscript. It proves neither the asserted bounds for physical
jets nor the existence, compatibility, or smooth extension of those jets.

All powers here have natural exponents. Constants and neighborhoods may depend
on the requested power, as they do in a flatness statement.
