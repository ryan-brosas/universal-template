# The actual inverse estimate at a fixed Sobolev order

Differentiate the genuine equation once at each of finitely many base
indices. The resulting constant is a fixed polynomial recursion in the
ordinary inverse norm and the finite coefficient-jet bound. It does not
depend on any external derivative order or factorial shift.
