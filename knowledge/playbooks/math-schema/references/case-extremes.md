# Case study: extreme values, or the wall the tilt cannot climb

This case starts where case-large-deviations.md section 7 and
case-gaertner-ellis.md section 8 pointed and builds the tool that
replaces the exponential tilt on the far side: block maxima and their
three limit laws. One example carries the whole method, plus the honest
map of what breaks and what replaces it.

## 1. The Cramér condition and its exact failure

The course's engine is the moment generating function. For a Pareto
claim size with tail $\mathbb{P}(Y > y) = (k/y)^\alpha$ on $y \ge k$
($\alpha > 0$, $k > 0$), density $\alpha k^\alpha y^{-\alpha-1}$ (the
negative derivative of the tail, one-line check), the mgf at ANY
$t > 0$ is infinite. Proof: the exponential series
$e^{ty} = \sum\_{N \ge 0} (t y)^N/N!$ is a sum of nonnegative terms, so
it dominates any single term; choose $N$ to exceed $\alpha$, then

$$
\mathbb{E} e^{tY} = \int\_k^\infty e^{ty} \alpha k^\alpha y^{-\alpha-1} \  dy
\ge (\alpha k^\alpha t^N/N!) \int\_k^\infty y^{N-\alpha-1} \  dy = \infty
$$

because the exponent $N - \alpha - 1$ of the surviving power is above
$-1$ (the integral of $y^p$ over $[k, \infty)$ diverges exactly at
$p \ge -1$, the antiderivative written out). PROVEN pointwise: one term
of one series kills the transform. Consequences, named: Chernoff has no
exponent here (case-large-deviations.md section 2 needs $M$ finite to
budget the tilt), the Lundberg adjustment equation has no root
(case-gaertner-ellis.md section 6 needs $\mathbb{E} e^{rY} < \infty$),
and on this side of the wall the theory restarts around maxima, not
sums. This is the honest opening: first exhibit the wall, then build
the theory that lives behind it.

## 2. Block maxima: the exact distribution

$M\_n := \max(Y\_1, \dots, Y\_n)$, $Y\_i$ i.i.d. with distribution $F$. The
maximum is at most $u$ exactly when all $n$ observations are at most
$u$; independence turns and into a product:
$\mathbb{P}(M\_n \le u) = F(u)^n$. PROVEN: intersection formulation plus
the independence factorization, both named.

The whole extreme value program is the study of how $F(u)^n$ behaves
when $u$ grows with $n$ so the product neither collapses to $0$ nor
freezes at $1$. The scales for the Pareto are computable by hand. Set
$u\_n := k n^{1/\alpha}$:

$$
\mathbb{P}(Y > u\_n) = (k/(k n^{1/\alpha}))^\alpha = 1/n
$$

(powers cancel term by term, PROVEN arithmetic). Then for $x > 0$,

$$
\mathbb{P}(M\_n \le u\_n x) = (1 - \mathbb{P}(Y > u\_n x))^n
= (1 - 1/(n x^\alpha))^n \to \exp(-x^{-\alpha}),
$$

using the standard limit $(1 - c/n)^n \to e^{-c}$, justified by the log
series $\log(1 + z) = z + \text{smaller terms}$ at $z = -c/n$ with
remainder $O(1/n^2)$; the same series the course ran from case-ewma.md
onward. PROVEN up to that cited series. The nondegenerate limit is

$$
G\_\alpha(x) = \exp(-x^{-\alpha}), \qquad x > 0,
$$

the Fréchet distribution.

## 3. The three limit laws

Fisher-Tippett-Gnedenko (cited theorem, the classification the rest of
the case will use without re-proving): the only possible nondegenerate
limits of centered-scaled maxima are three families, and which one a
tail produces is decided by the tail itself.

1. Frechet (polar heavy tail): $F$ has regularly varying tail of index
   $-\alpha$; the Pareto above is the emblem and produces $G\_\alpha$.
2. Gumbel (thin or moderate tail): exponential or Gaussian tails; the
   exponential from case-gaertner-ellis.md section 6 is the emblem,
   centered at $(\ln n)/\gamma$ with scale $1/\gamma$ and limit
   $\exp(-e^{-x})$.
3. Weibull (bounded support): the tail dies at a finite right endpoint
   $r$ with a power surplus $(r - y)^\beta$; the limit is
   $\exp(-(-x)^\beta)$.

The Pareto example above computed its own centering
$u\_n = k n^{1/\alpha}$ and scale; maximum domains require that the same
centering works uniformly, and for the Pareto it does (section 2's
computation).

## 4. One fixture, fully computed

Take $\alpha = 2$, $k = 1$. Then

$$
u\_n = n^{1/2}, \qquad \mathbb{P}(M\_n \le n^{1/2} x) \to \exp(-x^{-2}).
$$

Return-level reading, both directions recomputed: the typical
maximum of $n$ Pareto squares is around $1.201\  n^{1/2}$, because the
median of the Frechet limit solves $\exp(-x^{-2}) = 1/2$, that is
$-x^{-2} = \ln(1/2) = -0.6931$, $x = 1/\sqrt{0.6931} = 1.2011$ (log
table arithmetic). Halved scales:
$\mathbb{P}(M\_n > (1/2) n^{1/2}) \to 1 - \exp(-4) = 1 - 0.0183 = 0.9817$,
since $x = 1/2$ gives $-x^{-2} = -4$: the maximum clears half its
typical scale almost always (the limit is exact, the decimals from the
exponential table, arithmetic PROVEN). $n = 10^6$ makes $u\_n = 1000$
exactly: the $10^6$ observations' maximum is medially around $1201$,
and clears $500$ with limiting probability $0.9817$. SUPPORTED by the
recomputed decimals against the closed forms.

## 5. Why thin tails need a different centering

Exponential claims, $\mathbb{P}(Y > y) = e^{-\gamma y}$, rate $\gamma$
(the case of case-gaertner-ellis.md section 6): try the centering
$c\_n := (\ln n)/\gamma$:

$$
\mathbb{P}(M\_n \le c\_n + x/\gamma)
= (1 - \exp(-\gamma c\_n - x))^n = (1 - e^{-x}/n)^n \to \exp(-e^{-x}),
$$

the Gumbel limit, the same $(1 - c/n)^n$ engine as section 2 with
$c = e^{-x}$ and a constant scale $1/\gamma$ (the centering grows only
logarithmically because the tail already dies; the scale stays $O(1)$
because no power disputes it). PROVEN with the named limit. Contrast
the two orders in one line each: heavy tails center at $n^{1/\alpha}$
(power), light tails at $(\ln n)/\gamma$ (logarithm): the maximum of
exponential sizes grows as slowly as logarithms grow, a first honest
image of why tails decide extremes.

Gaussian tails sit in the same Gumbel class with centering
approximately $\sqrt{2 \ln n}$ and the Mills-ratio corrections the
course already proved in case-large-deviations.md section 4 (cited; the
refinement exercise is the natural next fixture).

## 6. The two transfer principles, stated exactly

Block maxima put the three families in place; their domains that matter
in data are read off through two further engines, cited and not
re-proven:

1. Peak-over-threshold: exceedances beyond a high level $u$ satisfy
   the generalized Pareto distribution asymptotically, $F\_u$-type
   approx $\mathrm{GPD}(\xi, \sigma)$: the conditional tail of $Y - u$
   given $Y > u$. The same shape parameter $\xi$ carries the class:
   $\xi > 0$ heavy, $\xi = 0$ Gumbel, $\xi < 0$ Weibull (the sign
   convention converting between the two parameterizations). POT is
   the sample-efficient twin of block maxima (cited; complements
   rather than replaces section 2).
2. Von Mises conditions: differentiability of the reciprocal hazard
   in the right tail decides the domain of attraction; for the Pareto
   and exponential emblems the conditions reduce to one-line limits
   read from the densities computed in this file (cited; the checks
   are exercises).

The reason the folder title says tail risk: capital measures that
condition on the extreme right (reinsurance layers, value at risk at
high confidence) are EXACTLY parameters of GPD, which is why
case-gaertner-ellis.md section 8 parked ruin theory at the wall this
case climbs.

## 7. Where the frontier is

- Regular variation and Karamata theory: the slow (power) variation
  calculus that runs Frechet centering in general maximization domains
  (cited; the $n^{1/\alpha}$ computation above is the emblem case).
- Multivariate and spatial extremes: maxima of fields need stable
  exponent-measures on cones rather than single laws (cited).
- Clustering of extremes: time series produce bursts of exceedances and
  the extremal index corrects the independence factorization of
  section 2 (cited) - the memory step that mirrors what Gärtner-Ellis
  did for sums in case-gaertner-ellis.md section 8.
